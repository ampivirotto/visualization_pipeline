Pipeline Notes: 

3/23/2020: 	Run bash file: 
				Added to bash script to make list of files 
				For gtc2vcf bcftools command:
					Lines   total/missing-reference/skipped:        716503/0/632
				Create a log file??  
				
3/25/2020:	Wrote python program testing_geoparse.py
				Functions include:
					identifyChip - choose files based on user input
					checkDir - check to see if directory is made if not make 
					retrieveGEOFiles - get GEO files and metadata based on user input
					makeBashFile - make bash file to run previous pipeline
					runBash - run the bash script via subprocess module 
				Testing the python program with GEO GSE74100:
					Lines   total/missing-reference/skipped:        1175489/1/1312
					Need to make sure Log file is working correctly for future runs
					Implement bcftools sort, normalize, and index - part of bash script

3/26/2020:	Tried to implement bcftools sort:
				When run it - emptied out the file - sort went to standard out not new file?
				Reran the gtc2vcf tool for GSE93106:
					Lines   total/missing-reference/skipped:        716503/0/632
			Using testing_geoparse.py for a small sample set for demonstration:
				Using GEO GSE67660:
					python testing_geoparse.py GSE67660 /mnt/d/visualization_pipeline/data/ human_omni small_sample.vcf
					Lines   total/missing-reference/skipped:        4284426/2998/6638
